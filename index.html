                The goal of this website is to host and showcase some of the projects that I’ve created. 
                This portfolio website helps demonstrate various development projects, design practices, and academic research I’ve conducted with a
                 focus on games as meaningful experiences.

            <h3>Enter the Gungeon Clone</h3>
            <p>For this project I created a game that resembles a simplified version of Enter the Gungeon. Move, shoot, and roll as you explore the dungeon and face off against the creatures inside. The game includes multiple different weapons, accessories, and enemies to showcase how to create a clone of Enter the Gungeon in Unity. </p>

            <p>A test demo showcasing some of the URP 2D lights inside Unity and how they react with both hand drawn and generated normal maps. Additionally the demo showcases dynamic swinging lights that react to players movements. All of these elements come together to showcase how lighting and reactive elements enhance a scene. </p>

            <h3>Games & Grief: Narrative Games as a Source of Healing</h3>
            <p>The main focus of this research paper was on grief and the effects that single player narratively driven games have on the grieving process. I conducted my own research through open ended surveys and interviews in addition to analysing academic articles on the topic to create my own conclusions on the subject. </p>

            <h3>About</h3>
            <p>My name’s Samuel Doerr and I’m an undergraduate student at Michigan State University in the Games and Interactive Media department. Video games have been a constant positive force in my life, helping me through some of the toughest moments in my life while providing me with valuable memories to this day. For me games are more than just a form of entertainment and that’s why I’ve pursued a degree in the field of Games and Interactive Media. One day I hope to help publish games that both entertain and leave positive lasting impressions on players, just as they have for me.<br> 
Currently I’m working on various small scale demos inside Unity to quickly showcase and highlight unique gameplay styles and scenes. Additionally, I’ve been working on UI/UX design inside Figma and After Effects, planning to create reactive UI/UX scenes that could be easily implemented into a game engine.
